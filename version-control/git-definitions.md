# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control is the process of organizing a software system and its many versions and configurations. It's useful because it helps maintain code documents that get revised a lot & also get edited by a variety of different users.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch in Git is a copy of a project that one is working on. Branching is important because it allows for different features of a project to be worked on simultaneously and then merged back in. It also allows for features or experiments to be discarded if they have failed.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Committing a set of files and folders means that we are creating a save point for the project. A good commit message is usually detailed and says what has changed since the last commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflicts generally happen when multiple people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. Files with conflicting changes can be viewed within merge conflicts.
